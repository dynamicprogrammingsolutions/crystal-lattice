Assess whether this task handoff and the resulting plan would let another
agent continue correctly without the original conversation or broad
rediscovery.

Use the reviewed target as the authority. Judge the task and plan together:
requirements and approved conditions, verified facts and source pointers,
material decisions and questions, exclusions, dependencies, testing
boundaries, documentation work, and plan status. An omit-plan task must not
contain disguised implementation direction, but the later plan must still be
complete. A retained-plan task should let the later agent reuse the plan rather
than reconstruct it unnecessarily.

Tool-call efficiency is secondary. Interpret it only after plan quality. Do not
reward a low call count when the plan omits outcomes or invents unsupported
behavior.

This is a read-only planning stage. Do not penalize a plan because newly
verified details remain in the response rather than being written back into
the task file; file mutation is prohibited here. Judge whether the presented
plan is complete and whether the durable task was sufficient to produce it.

The `incomplete` variant is an intentional negative control. It should require
more reconstruction or produce lower-quality planning than a complete handoff;
assess the result rather than assuming failure from the label.

The `generated-file` variant is a fresh-session plan made only from another
agent's generated task files: judge whether those files alone let the planning
agent produce a complete plan without broad rediscovery.

Use focused component tests for active selection, filtered results, and empty state, plus a live integration check that mounts the component with the real API module and Axios transport against Flask.\n\n### Implementation decisions and open questions\n- No requirement questions are open. Use the smallest shared refresh helper; preserve existing mutation success and response behavior.\n- The decisive integration check must cross the mounted Vue component, production client transport, and Flask route\u2014not mock the API or substitute Flask\u2019s test client.\n\n### Documentation\n- No documentation change is expected for this regression fix.\n\n### Task checklist\n- [ ] Confirm all mutation refresh paths use the selected filter.\n- [ ] Add component coverage for add, update, and delete refreshes, including visible selection, results, and empty state.\n- [ ] Add an integration check using the real client transport and Flask route.\n- [ ] Run focused client and server tests; verify existing CRUD and unfiltered behavior.\n\n### Requirement verification\n- `REFRESH-1`\u2013`REFRESH-3`: Exercise add, update, and delete from the mounted component against a live Flask server using the production client API and Axios transport; assert the filter query, active choice, rendered results, and empty state.\n- `REFRESH-4`: Run existing CRUD and unfiltered tests, and assert mutation success and response behavior remain compatible.\n\nNo files were modified.

    "summary": "The retained handoff preserved exactly what retain_plan requires: selected-state owner, refresh call paths, compatibility constraints, and the real crossing. The resulting plan covers all four plan-target items: PLAN-1 via 'retain selectedFilter as the source of truth' with one filter-aware fetch path; PLAN-2 via the mounted-component -> real API module/Axios -> live Flask route path with the filter query asserted; PLAN-3 via component coverage asserting visible active choice, rendered results, and empty state for add/update/delete (grouping permitted by acceptable_alternatives); PLAN-4 via preserved mutation success/response behavior and existing CRUD and unfiltered tests. The testing boundary is decisive: the plan explicitly forbids mocking the API or substituting Flask's test client, matching the important crossing. Documentation 'no change' is appropriate for an internal regression fix. Plan status stays Draft with no files modified, respecting the read-only stage. Minor imperfection: the plan says 'the Vue component' without restating Books.vue, relying on the task file's pointer, and frames the call path largely through its verification design; neither loses material information since the durable task retains the concrete anchors."
