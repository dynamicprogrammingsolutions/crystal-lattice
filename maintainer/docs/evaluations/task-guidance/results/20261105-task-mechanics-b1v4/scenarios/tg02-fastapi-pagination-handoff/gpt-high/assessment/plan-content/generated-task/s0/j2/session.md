Assess the presented plan below — the response one agent produced when
asked to present its implementation plan for a fixed task. Judge what
a human reader of this text alone would get. You are the human reader.

The plan is judged against two requirement layers. Grade every
requirement: `conveyed` when the plan carries the content a reader
needs (briefly is fine), `partial` when some of it is present or it is
present but unclear, `missing` when the reader would not get it. The
two special requirements use their own grades, listed with them.

Rules that apply across all requirements:

- Any requirement graded below its top grade requires a finding: name
  where the plan falls short, concretely, quoting or pointing at the
  passage. An empty finding with a non-top grade is invalid.
- A requirement whose meaning depends on an external resource the
  reader must open grades at most `partial`, however good the resource
  is. Links may carry extra evidence; they must never replace content
  the reader needs.
- Depth must match impact: verbosity is not rewarded, and brevity that
  loses nothing is not penalized.
- Judge content, not formatting. How the plan is typeset is not graded
  here; what it conveys is.

Generic requirements (every plan):

- GENERIC-1 (conveyed/partial/missing): High-impact decisions, each marked decided or open: the decisions that shape the work are surfaced — not buried in steps — each labeled decided (with brief rationale) or open (as an explicit approval question, with a recommendation when one exists).
- GENERIC-2 (conveyed/partial/missing): The result at its public boundary before mechanics: what the finished work produces — behavior, contract, surface change — so direction and construction are judgeable separately.
- GENERIC-3 (conveyed/partial/missing): What stays untouched and why: existing behavior that must remain compatible, and scope deliberately excluded.
- GENERIC-4 (conveyed/partial/missing): The constraints and assumptions that shaped the approach: the hard constraints that ruled out alternatives, and the assumptions relied on with how each could be cheaply confirmed.
- GENERIC-5 (conveyed/partial/missing): Verification with a decisive boundary: what evidence, at which boundary, would prove the outcomes — and what that verification deliberately does not cover.
- GENERIC-6 (conveyed/partial/missing): Risks, blast radius, and the way back: what could break and for whom; the reversibility answer — rollback, phases that keep every step shippable, escape hatches.
- GENERIC-7 (conveyed/partial/missing): The logic of the sequence: why the steps are in this order (dependencies, contract before consumers, risk first) and the milestones where progress becomes verifiable or usable.
- GENERIC-8 (conveyed/partial/missing): What feedback the plan needs from the reader: approvals wanted, questions needing answers, priorities to confirm — stated, not implied.
- GENERIC-9 (self-contained/partial/external-dependency): Self-containedness: everything needed to evaluate the plan is in the text — facts stated not referenced; links carry, never replace (delete every link and code reference, the plan must still be evaluable); terms introduced at first use; earlier context restated in decided form; snippets illustrate while prose asserts; specifics appear as values. The duty covers evaluation-relevant facts, not every detail.
- GENERIC-10 (proportionate/over-detailed): Depth follows decisions; mechanics stay summarized: promises with boundaries instead of specifications, strategy over inventory, public surface over internal mechanics. Detail earns its place only when changing it would change the reader's decision.

Task-specific requirements for this scenario (what a plan for THIS
task must convey):

- PLAN-1 (conveyed/partial/missing): The query contract: what `limit` and `offset` mean, their defaults and bounds, and how invalid values are rejected — as a contract, not an exhaustive validation rule list.
- PLAN-2 (conveyed/partial/missing): Response compatibility: an unparameterized request still returns the full-list array; a requested slice keeps the note array shape and adds the total count via a response header.
- PLAN-3 (conveyed/partial/missing): The stable ascending note-ID ordering guarantee for requested slices.
- PLAN-4 (conveyed/partial/missing): How create, item-read, update, and delete behavior remains compatible.
- PLAN-5 (conveyed/partial/missing): The verification approach exercises the route through the running application — not only data-layer shapes.

Approved outcomes of the scenario (the authority the plan serves; use
them to harvest content the requirement lists may have missed):

- NOTES-1: `GET /notes/` accepts optional validated limit and offset controls.
- NOTES-2: Unparameterized requests preserve the full-list array behavior.
- NOTES-3: Requested slices use stable ascending note-ID order.
- NOTES-4: Paginated responses retain the note array and expose total count in a response header.
- NOTES-5: Invalid values use normal FastAPI validation.
- NOTES-6: Create, item-read, update, and delete behavior remains compatible.

Return JSON only with this shape:

{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "scenario_id": "tg02-fastapi-pagination-handoff",
  "assessment": {
    "requirements": {
      "REQUIREMENT-ID": {
        "grade": "…",
        "finding": "required unless the grade is top; empty otherwise"
      }
    },
    "missed_requirements": [
      "human-needed content neither layer above asked for, if any"
    ],
    "summary": "concise evidence-based interpretation"
  }
}

Every requirement id from both layers must appear exactly once in
`requirements`. Grade scales are strict: every requirement uses
conveyed/partial/missing EXCEPT GENERIC-9, whose grades are
self-contained/partial/external-dependency, and GENERIC-10, whose
grades are proportionate/over-detailed. Grading GENERIC-9 or
GENERIC-10 as `conveyed` is invalid.

The presented plan:

**Draft Plan — Optional `GET /notes/` Pagination**

Add optional `limit` and `offset` to the collection endpoint. Paginated results remain JSON arrays, ordered by ascending note ID, and include the total note count in a response header. Requests without pagination keep returning the full-list array. Use FastAPI’s normal request validation for invalid values.

Keep the change confined to collection retrieval, any narrowly scoped persistence support, focused API tests, and the README. Leave detail, create, update, and delete route behavior unchanged. No new specification page is planned.

**Open Contract Questions**
- What exact header name should carry the total count?
- Should the header appear only on paginated responses or on every collection response?
- Should negative values be rejected, and is `limit=0` valid?
- If only `offset` is supplied, should the endpoint return all remaining notes?

**Order and Verification**
Resolve those contract questions first, since they determine parameter validation and response assertions. Then implement the route and persistence behavior, add `TestClient` integration coverage using the real persistence setup, and update the README. Verify slice boundaries, ascending IDs, total count, no-parameter full-list compatibility, and FastAPI validation for agreed invalid inputs. Exercise the other CRUD routes through the real API to confirm they remain unchanged.

The blast radius is limited to collection retrieval and its documentation. Keep the change additive; if it regresses list behavior or the header contract, revert the route/query and documentation changes together and rerun focused tests. The proposed checks do not cover large-dataset performance or broader application-wide compatibility.

The plan remains **Draft**. Execution is not approved; the contract questions need resolution before implementation.
